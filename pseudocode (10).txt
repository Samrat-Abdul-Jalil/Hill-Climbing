Problem: Sorting a list in ascending order
Algorithm: Hill Climbing (Steepest ascent)

#Init():
	initialize a list -> [2, 1, 5, 0, 8, 4, 10, 0, 20, 10]

#calc_cost(state):
	# You will require a nested for loop
	for each element of the list:
		look forward in the list and see how many elements are smaller than this element (they are in the wrong order)
	Add up the number of disorders and return
	

#state_generation(current_state, current_state_cost):
	# You will need a nested for loop
	for each element in the list:
		swap with the forward elements of the list with this element one by one and generate one state for each swap.
		calculate cost for each generated state using calc_cost() function.
	# Do not store the states and the corresponding costs to determine smallest cost state
	# Rather use check and replace by last smallest cost state approach in the above nested loop (think about minimum number #determination from array)
	take that generated state which has the smallest cost
	if smallest cost is smaller than current_state_cost:
		return that state along with the new cost 
	else :
		return current_state, None
		 

#goal_test(state):
	if calc_cost(state) == 0:
		return True
	else:
		retrun False
		

state = init()
while(!goal_test(state)):
	cost = calc_cost(state)
	state, cost = state_generation(state, cost)
	# When you are stuck, your cost will be None 
	if cost is None:
		print(state)
		FINISH
print(state)
FINISH
